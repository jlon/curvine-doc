# CSI Framework And Mount Lifecycle

This page describes the behavior implemented in `curvine-csi` on the current main branch, not an older Helm-based design.

## Core Model

Curvine CSI has three moving parts:

| Component | Source | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Controller service | `pkg/csi/controller.go` | Validates provisioning parameters, creates or deletes Curvine directories, and returns the final `VolumeContext` |
| Node service | `pkg/csi/node.go` | Starts or reuses FUSE, computes host mount paths, and bind-mounts the right subdirectory into pods |
| FUSE process manager | `pkg/csi/fuse_manager.go` | Launches `/opt/curvine/curvine-fuse` with the generated mount path and pass-through FUSE flags |

## Mount Modes

`pkg/csi/driver.go` reads `MOUNT_MODE`:

- `embedded`: default in the Helm chart; FUSE runs inside the CSI node pod
- `standalone`: optional mode; FUSE runs in dedicated standalone pods

Operationally:

- `embedded` is simpler to deploy and operate, but restarting or upgrading the CSI node pod also interrupts the FUSE process.
- `standalone` isolates FUSE lifecycle from CSI pod restarts by running FUSE in dedicated standalone pods.

Helm chart defaults:

- `node.mountMode`: `embedded`
- Controller pods keep `MOUNT_MODE=embedded`

Raw `deploy/` manifests in the `curvine-csi` repository may still default node plugins to `standalone` until aligned with the Helm chart.

## Dynamic Provisioning Flow

### 1. StorageClass Validation

`ValidateStorageClassParams` in `pkg/csi/validator.go` enforces:

- `master-addrs` must be present and parse as `host:port,host:port,...`
- `fs-path` defaults to `/` when omitted
- `path-type` defaults to `Directory`
- legacy user-supplied `mnt-path` is still accepted, but the code path now auto-generates mount paths and treats manual `mnt-path` as compatibility behavior

The validator also accepts a set of optional FUSE tuning keys and forwards them to the node-side FUSE start logic.

### 2. Controller Output

For dynamic volumes, `CreateVolume` in `pkg/csi/controller.go` generates:

```text
cluster-id   = sha256(master-addrs)[:8]
volumeHandle = {cluster-id}@{fs-path}@{pv-name}
curvine-path = {fs-path}/{pv-name}
```

It then stores these values in `VolumeContext` for later node-side operations.

`path-type` controls directory creation:

- `Directory`: parent path and final volume path must already exist
- `DirectoryOrCreate`: missing directories are created by the controller

## Node-Side Mount Generation

### Cluster ID

`pkg/csi/volume_handle.go` derives:

```text
cluster-id = first 8 hex chars of SHA256(master-addrs)
```

This ID is part of the dynamic `volumeHandle`.

### Mount Key

The node service and helper functions derive a separate `mount-key` from:

```text
master-addrs + fs-path
```

That value is then used to generate the host FUSE mount point:

```text
/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/kubernetes.io/csi/curvine/{mount-key}/fuse-mount
```

This is the key point for reuse: the shared FUSE process is grouped by `master-addrs + fs-path`, not by PVC name.

## FUSE Reuse Rules

### Dynamic Volumes

For dynamic provisioning, volumes created from the same:

- `master-addrs`
- `fs-path`

reuse the same node-side FUSE mount on a given Kubernetes node. Each PVC still gets its own `curvine-path` underneath that shared mount.

### Static PVs

The static PV example uses:

- arbitrary `volumeHandle`
- required `master-addrs`
- required `curvine-path`

Static PVs do not need the structured dynamic `volumeHandle`. When `fs-path` is omitted, the node code falls back to `/` before generating the mount key. That means static PV reuse is effectively keyed by `master-addrs + /` unless you add an explicit `fs-path` attribute yourself.

This behavior is inferred from the current `node.go` implementation, where missing `fs-path` is replaced with `/` before `mount-key` generation.

## How NodePublishVolume Finds The Pod Subpath

`NodePublishVolume` in `pkg/csi/node.go` computes the host subpath differently depending on the mounted root:

- If `fs-path == /`, the host subpath is `mnt-path + curvine-path`
- If `fs-path != /`, the host subpath is `mnt-path + relative(curvine-path, fs-path)`

Examples from the implementation comments:

```text
fs-path="/", curvine-path="/pvc-abc"
=> host subpath = <mnt-path>/pvc-abc

fs-path="/test-data", curvine-path="/test-data/pvc-abc"
=> host subpath = <mnt-path>/pvc-abc
```

This is why multiple PVCs can share one FUSE process while still landing in different directories.

## FUSE Command Construction

`pkg/csi/fuse_manager.go` starts FUSE as:

```text
/opt/curvine/curvine-fuse --master-addrs ... --fs-path ... --mnt-path ...
```

It always injects:

- `--master-addrs`
- `--fs-path`
- `--mnt-path`

and then appends any CSI-supplied FUSE tuning flags.

The `curvine-fuse` CLI in the main reference exposes these documented flags directly:

- `--io-threads`
- `--worker-threads`
- `--mnt-per-task`
- `--clone-fd`
- `--fuse-channel-size`
- `--stream-channel-size`
- `--direct-io`
- `--cache-readdir`
- `--entry-timeout`
- `--attr-timeout`
- `--negative-timeout`
- `--max-background`
- `--congestion-threshold`
- `--node-cache-size`
- `--node-cache-timeout`
- `--mnt-number`

The validator also still accepts several older keys such as `auto-cache`, `kernel-cache`, `master-hostname`, `master-rpc-port`, and `master-web-port`. Those keys are not separately documented on the current `curvine-fuse` CLI page, so treat them as compatibility behavior rather than a stable public contract.

## Lifecycle Summary

1. The controller validates StorageClass parameters and creates `curvine-path`.
2. The controller returns `VolumeContext` containing `master-addrs`, `fs-path`, and `curvine-path`.
3. The node plugin computes `cluster-id`, `mount-key`, and `mnt-path`.
4. If a compatible FUSE process already exists for that `master-addrs + fs-path` pair, the node reuses it.
5. Otherwise, the node starts a new `curvine-fuse` process.
6. The node bind-mounts the correct subdirectory into the pod.
7. When reference count reaches zero, `NodeUnstageVolume` stops the unused FUSE mount.

## Static Versus Dynamic PVs

| Mode | Required attributes | Controller behavior | Node behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dynamic PVC via StorageClass | `master-addrs`, optional `fs-path`, optional `path-type` | Generates `volumeHandle` and `curvine-path` | Mounts `fs-path`, then bind-mounts the generated subdirectory |
| Static PV | `master-addrs`, `curvine-path` | No directory naming convention is generated for you | Mounts root by default if `fs-path` is omitted, then bind-mounts `curvine-path` |

## Operational Guidance

- Use `standalone` when CSI node pod restarts or upgrades must not interrupt the business FUSE process; `embedded` is the Helm default for simpler deployments.
- Set `fs-path` explicitly in StorageClasses even though the code defaults it to `/`. That makes reuse behavior and directory layout predictable.
- Do not depend on manual `mnt-path` assignment in new deployments; the main branch implementation already auto-generates it.
